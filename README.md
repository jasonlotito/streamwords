### URL Options
#### hp
Hides the preview window.

#### sw=NNN

Sets the width of the sidebar (settings panel) to whatever is set here.

#### show=XXXX

Shows the specific settings panel for the overlay that you want. 
Showing the section is the name of the section with spaces removed. For
example, if you only want to show the `StreamWords` configuration, you
add `show=StreamWords` and this will hide everything except the 
`Global Settings` and the `StreamWords` settings.

#### Example

`https://younow.damnscout.com/admin?hp&sw=100%&show=StreamWords` will
only show the `StreamWords` settings along with the Global Settings. This
makes the settings easier to embed into other platforms.
## StreamWords

Info coming soon.
