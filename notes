Give game bonus if someone invites fans.
    * Need to figure out if we can see who has invited outside of event stream tracking
    * This means those who invite before game starts gets benefits

Check for free 20s
    * Would have to differentiate between gifts, free spin, and other forms
    * Can we tell if it's free 20s or no?
